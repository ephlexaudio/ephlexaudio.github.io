            Mike Adams knew he wanted to be an engineer from an early age.  While his friends got into trouble for general mischief,
            he got into trouble for taking things apart, though he much preferred to put things together with LEGOs.
            In high school, he took courses in electronics and computer science, then got his Bachelor's Degree in Electrical
            Engineering from the University of Idaho.  Throughout his career, he has taken classes in programming and enjoys working
            in both areas.  In his spare time, he enjoys working on his own projects, which generally focus on audio processing.
          </p>

            Mike has worked in a variety of fields and a variety of positions, from an Operations Engineer in a medical device company to a Component Security Analyst at a National Laboratory.
